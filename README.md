# 100 million row challenge

A simplified version of the 1 billion row challenge, and where any language goes!

Generate a 1.37GB measurements file with the generate_data.py script. Pypy is recommended for faster generation times.

```
python generate_data.py
```

### Time measuring

I run the tests on my fully charged laptop with the following specs:

-   AMD Ryzen 7 5700U
-   Disk: NVMe Intel SSDPEKNW512GZL
